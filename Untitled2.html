heard quiet steps behind him. That didn't bode well. Who could be

And at this particular moment, just after he pulled off the big time
and was making off with the greenbacks. Was there another crook who'd

him and waiting for a chance to grab the fruit of his labor? Or did
the steps behind him mean that one of many law officers in town was
on to him and just waiting to pounce and snap those cuffs on his
wrists? He nervously looked all around. Suddenly he saw the alley.
Like lightning he darted off to the left and disappeared between the
two warehouses almost falling over the trash can lying in the middle
of the sidewalk. He tried to nervously tap his way along in the inky
darkness and suddenly stiffened: it was a dead-end, he would have to
go back the way he had come. The steps got louder and louder, he saw
the black outline of a figure coming around the corner. Is this the
end of the line? he <a href="">thought</a> pressing himself back
against the wall trying to make himself invisible in the dark, was
all that planning and energy wasted? He was dripping with sweat now,
cold and wet, he could smell the fear coming off his clothes.
Suddenly next to him, with a barely noticeable squeak, a door swung
quietly to and fro in the night's breeze. Could this be the haven
he'd prayed for? Slowly he slid toward the door, pressing himself
more and more into the wall, into the dark, away from his enemy.
Would this door save his hide?</font></font></font></p>
