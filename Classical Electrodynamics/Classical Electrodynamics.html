			<h1>Classic Electromagnetism Diagram</h1>

			<p>As many Undergrad student, I strugled through Classical Eletrodynamics. </p>

			<p>I studied a lot and I did this very nice diagram, which helps you to locate yourself inside Electromagnetism. It makes easy to see "where you are".</p>
			
			<p>The diagram was based on the book Introduction to Electrodynamics by David J. Griffiths, 3rd ed. and the equation numbers follow the equation number in the book (some equations that aren't in the book have a generic number).</p>
			
			<p> Note that red links show some kind of restriction. The suggested paper size for printing is A1.</p>
			
			<p>Click <a href="classicalElectrodynamics.pdf"> HERE</a> to download the pdf file.</p>
			
			<p>You can download the latex file <a href="Classical Eletrodynamics Diagram.zip">here</a>. Fell free to modify it to better suit your needs, just make sure people know that you downloaded it here and that you've modified it.</p>
			
			<p>Warning: I have found a few typo errors, I will fix asap.</p>
