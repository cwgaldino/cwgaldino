			<h1>Invar effect studied using time-resolved x-ray diffraction</h1>
			
			<p>Most recently, I've been studying the Invar effect using time resolved X-ray diffraction at Advanced Photon Source in Chicago. I still got a lot of data analysis to do and this is just a preview of the full work.</p>
		
			<p>The invar effect can be found in FeNi alloys (you may find it in other alloys, but FeNi is the one I'm focused on). </p>
			
			<p>Invar alloys have the property to have a extremely low coefficient of thermal expansion for a big range of temperature; In other words, the material does not expand nor contracts when exposed to temperature changes.</p>

			<p>The experiment was performed using a pump and probe technique. Pulses of laser, 800nm, were used as pump and x-rays pulses as probe. The laser would heat up the sample and a short period of time later the x-ray would hit the sample, diffracting while the sample is still exctied.</p>
			
			<p>We discorvered that for short periods of time (of order of pico seconds) the invar effect is not seen.</p>
			
			<p>As you may seen through the graph below, which is a graph, in a log scale, of the difference of intensity for a certain Bragg peak between a normal peak and an excited peak as a function of the delay between the laser and the x-ray.</p>
			
			<p>In short periods of time, the difference is relatively big, which means that the Bragg peak in question has moved (changed position) due to photon excitation. This changing caracterizes a expansion of the unity cell.</p>
			
			<p>After a time of 10<sup>-8</sup> seconds the sample starts "healing" and after 10<sup>-6</sup> seconds it is "healed", characterizing the Invar effect.</p>
			
			<p>The different colors means different laser power.</p>
