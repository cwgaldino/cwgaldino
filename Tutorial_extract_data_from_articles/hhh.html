this tutorial, we are going to extract data from figures in pdfâ€™s
using a vector graphics editor (<a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>),
a text editor, and a spreadsheet software. In principle, any other
vector graphics editor will work. As for the spreadsheet software, I
am using <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/">LibreOffice
Calc</a>. Before we began, we have to understand I little about
digital graphic formats.</font></font></font></p>

graphics. The mais difference between then is that raster graphics
(.png, .jpg, ...) are made of pixels, while vector graphics (.svg,
.eps, ...) are made of vector cartesian points. The figure below is
an example of raster image. Note that, if you zoom in on the image,
the image starts to get blurry.</font></font></font></p>

we have an example of a vector image. Note that, no matter how much
you zoom in on the image there is no blur. This is what makes vector
format perfect for high-quality publication figures or presentation
on big screens. Raster images should be preferred mostly when the
image is a photograph (sometimes, heatmaps are also better presented
using raster format).</font></font></font></p>
