<p class="western">In this tutorial, we are going to extract data
from figures in pdf’s using a vector graphics editor (<a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>),
a text editor, and a spreadsheet software. In principle, any other
vector graphics editor will work. As for the spreadsheet software, I
am using <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/">LibreOffice
Calc</a>. Before we began, we have to understand I little about
digital graphic formats.</p>

graphic formats</b></font></font></font></p>
<p class="western">We can split up digital images into two groups:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics">vector</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics">raster</a>
graphics. The mais difference between then is that raster graphics
(.png, .jpg, ...) are made of pixels, while vector graphics (.svg,
.eps, ...) are made of vector cartesian points. The figure below is
an example of raster image. Note that, if you zoom in on the image,
the image starts to get blurry.</p>
<p class="western" align="center" style="margin-left: 2.49cm; margin-right: 2.49cm; margin-top: 0.99cm; margin-bottom: 0.99cm; line-height: 200%">
<font color="#444444"><img src="raster_solid.png" name="Image3" align="bottom" hspace="29" vspace="29" width="526" height="311" border="0"/>

</font>
</p>
<p class="western">Below, we have an example of a vector image. Note
that, no matter how much you zoom in on the image there is no blur.
This is what makes vector format perfect for high-quality publication
figures or presentation on big screens. Raster images should be
preferred mostly when the image is a photograph (sometimes, heatmaps
are also better presented using raster format).</p>
